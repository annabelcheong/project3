# Project Overview
## Audience
- General Public interested in Wellbeing and Happiness

## Purpose and Objective
The purpose of the project is to produce a website to raise awareness on the factors which have the most influence on happiness for an individual. Ultimately, provoke the audience to think about how the factors (social support, money, country's corruption etc) apply to their happiness.

## Methodology and Approach 
Loading in raw data (csv format) and performing ETL on the dataset via Python Pandas. There will be 2 final dataframes resulting from the ETL. 
- The first dataframe will be converted back to a csv file, and loaded to Tableau Public to produce visualisations. 
- The second dataframe will be loaded to the PostGRES database, loaded into the Flask app web server as an API endpoint. Subsequently, the API endpoint will be referenced in a javascript to be deployed onto the html webpage.
